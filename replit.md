# Ascension Quest: Legends of Aethoria

A fitness RPG where real training, nutrition, recovery, and consistency become character growth and expeditions through Aethoria.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` - run the API server for local development
- `pnpm run typecheck` - full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` - typecheck and build all packages
- `pnpm run deploy:build` - production-focused web/API build for Replit
- `pnpm run deploy:migrate` - run Drizzle migrations against `DATABASE_URL`
- `pnpm run deploy:start` - start the production API, which also serves the built web app
- `pnpm run deploy:run` - run migrations first, then start production; this is what `.replit` uses
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` - regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` - push DB schema changes for dev only
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` - Postgres connection string

## Replit Production Setup

Use a single Replit deployment/domain for the web app and API. The Express API serves `/api/*`, Clerk proxy traffic remains at `/api/__clerk`, and all other browser routes fall back to the built Vite app.

1. Back up the existing Replit database before changing migrations or production secrets.
2. Add the values from `.env.example` to Replit Secrets. Do not commit real secret values.
3. Keep production bypasses disabled: `DEV_MOCK_API=false`, `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false`, and `VITE_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false`.
4. Deploy with the `.replit` production build/run commands. The run command executes `pnpm run deploy:run`, which applies Drizzle migrations before starting the API.
5. If Hall, Chronicle, or Character fail to load after a pull, manually run `pnpm run deploy:migrate` once and redeploy; those pages depend on the newer Guild Hall, Chronicle, item discovery, and paper-doll gear tables.
6. In Clerk/Replit Auth, allow the deployed domain for sign-in/sign-up redirects and enable Google as a provider.
7. For Expo/mobile testing, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to the deployed `https://...` origin.

Persistence check: create two Google accounts, complete setup for each, save nutrition/workout/equipment data, refresh, sign out, sign back in, and confirm each account sees only its own records.

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- Web: React/Vite
- Mobile: Expo
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Auth: Clerk with Google sign-in
- Validation: Zod and drizzle-zod
- API codegen: Orval from OpenAPI
- Build: Vite for web, esbuild for API

## Where Things Live

- Web app: `artifacts/fitness-rpg`
- Mobile app: `artifacts/fitness-rpg-mobile`
- API server: `artifacts/api-server`
- Database schema and migrations: `lib/db`

## Architecture Decisions

- Production uses one origin for web and API to avoid cross-domain auth/cookie complexity.
- Mock API and auth bypasses are development-only and must be false in production.
- PostgreSQL is the source of truth for user progress; object storage is reserved for future media/assets.
- Drizzle migrations are used for production schema changes. Do not reset production data.

## Product

Core destinations are Guild Hall, Training, Nutrition, Chronicle, and Character. The app turns real activity into commissions, combat replays, rewards, character identity, gear, and story progress.

## User Preferences

- Do not rewrite from scratch.
- Optimize for making the player excited to come back tomorrow.
- Preserve and migrate user data in place.
- Player-created guilds stay hidden for launch.

## Gotchas

- If `DEV_MOCK_API=true`, API calls can be handled by mock routes and may not persist to Postgres.
- If `DATABASE_URL` is missing outside mock mode, the API/database layer should fail rather than silently use fake storage.
- Hall, Chronicle, and Character depend on the latest migrations. If these tabs fail in Replit while older pages load, check the Replit logs for missing relation/table errors and run `pnpm run deploy:migrate`.
- The web app needs `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and the API needs `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` for authenticated production routes.
